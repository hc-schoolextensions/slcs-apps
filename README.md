## How to add or modify apps

1. Go to https://slcsapps.pages.dev/edit to start.
2. Visit https://fonts.google.com/icons?icon.style=Rounded&icon.set=Material+Icons and choose an icon for the app. To get the name of the icon, click on it. For example, the name of the icon titled "Account Circle" is "account_circle".
3. Add or edit a line. There is one line per app. The apps are in the following format. Replace capital letters with what they describe, but do not use capital letters in the data except in app names. Spaces are allowed: ```ICON_NAME::APP_URL::APP_NAME;;```

Example: ```search::https://www.google.com/::Google;;```

4. Make sure the data has no extra empty lines.
5. Fill in the description box at the bottom with a short description of what you modified.
6. Press "Sumbit".
